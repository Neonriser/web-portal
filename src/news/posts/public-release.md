We are excited to announce the latest developments regarding NetFind (formerly known as NaviNet) and the release of SurfScape. Since the initial version of NetFind, the project experienced several delays, which resulted in nearly a year-long process to establish guidelines for completing the web portal. However, we are pleased to inform you that the first part of the project is now complete. The main focus of NetFind was its open-source services, which unfortunately were never released or developed. However, the time for change has arrived. We have officially launched the initial release of the new NetFind now called SurfScape, featuring a more cohesive base code, ensuring the continuity of the project.

## What to Expect

At this time, the web portal is the only completed component. However, in the coming days, we will also release AdZone and, particularly, GameVortex to the public. We will provide a detailed announcement here, explaining all the relevant information.

We wanted to ensure the project remained alive within the community, which is why we focused on completing the web portal first. By doing so, we can generate attention while we work on finalizing our services.

You may have noticed that our services are hosted on GitHub. This decision was made due to limited storage capacity for the portal. Adopting a modular approach and hosting each service in its own repository allowed us to manage the project more efficiently without impacting the main website.

## Resource Library

During the past few weeks, our primary focus has been on the web portal and resolving issues related to the upcoming services, particularly GameVortex. Unfortunately, due to time constraints, one of our key features, the Resource Library, has not been developed yet. This _service_ will serve as a collection of resources from various web sources, including our owns. Additionally, the Resource Library will feature a downloads section offering website templates, applications, themes, and other content for Neocities users. We regret to inform you that the project is still in its early stages, and we have not yet finalized our plans. However, we can confirm that it will be hosted within the web portal itself.

## Final Remarks

The objective of this release is simple: to gather feedback from our users regarding the web portal and to test its functionality in a public enviroment. Furthermore, this period will allow us more time to plan and subsequently release stable versions of our services. We have developed SurfScape with the personal and community aspects in mind, aiming for a less corporate approach.

Thank you for your support and enthusiasm. We hope you enjoy the new and improved NetFind, now called SurfScape. We value both the individual and collective experiences and look forward to embarking on this journey with you (and the Neocities community as a whole).

Best regards,

ReduxFlakes
Creator and Developer of SurfScape.
