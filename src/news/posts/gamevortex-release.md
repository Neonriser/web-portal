We are happu to announce that after 2 months of coding and testing, the SurfScape gaming portal, GameVortex, has been officially released to the public for testing! If you would like to test it out, please follow [this link](https://surfscape.github.io/gamevortex/).

GameVortex is a reimagined version of the old NaviNet Games services, offering a more features, cleaner source code, and most importantly, greater flexibility. It not only supports Flash games but also provides beta support for Unity and HTML5 games!

Currently, our games library is small; however, more games will be added over time, and users will have the option to request specific games as well.

Like everything we do, GameVortex is open source on GitHub, and you are welcome to contribute to the code! Visit [https://github.com/surfscape/gamevortex](https://github.com/surfscape/gamevortex) for more information.
