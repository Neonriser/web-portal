## Welcome

Welcome to SurfScape, “your friendly Neocities web portal” inspired by the aesthetics and values of the old/indie web. At SurfScape, we’re passionate about preserving the spirit of the early internet and creating a hub that brings the Neocities community together, fosters creativity, and provides an escape from the chaos that we call the modern web.

Our vision for SurfScape is to showcase the best of what the old/indie web had and still has to offer while embracing new technologies and emerging trends in web design. Whether you’re a fan of quirky personal pages, subversive zines, or awesome services to empower the indie web, SurfScape is the place for you.

## Origin

The idea for SurfScape started as a personal website, but as our ambitions grew, we realized we needed something bigger to bring our vision to life. That’s when we started brainstorming ideas for a web portal that could provide a home for diverse communities and content that celebrates the creativity and diversity of the internet. That’s when SurfScape was born.

## Closing

At SurfScape, we’re a team of passionate internet enthusiasts who come from all walks of life and believe in a web that’s free, creative, open, and community-driven. We’re developers united by our love of the internet and our desire to create a space that’s both fun and safe. Whether you’re interested in coding, design, or just exploring new content, we’re here to help you get the most out of the web.

So come on in, explore our portal, and join our community. We can’t wait to see what you’ll discover at SurfScape!
