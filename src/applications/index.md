SurfScape Applications (also known as Apps/Applets) are small web and/or mobile applications targeted towards Neocities users. Our mission is to create easy-to-use tools and services that enhance the Neocities experience and support the values of the Neocities community.

**Currently, SurfScape Applications is in development and is not yet available to the public.** However, we are actively working on new applications and updating existing ones, and we welcome feedback and contributions from our users.
