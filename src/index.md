# Begin your jorney!

Welcome to the new SurfScape, "your friendly Neocities web portal" inspired by the aesthetics and values of the old/indie web. We believe in a web that's free, creative, open, and community-driven, and we're passionate about preserving the spirit of the early internet.

At SurfScape, you'll find a wide range of content and communities that celebrate the creativity and diversity of the internet. From quirky personal pages to subversive zines, and awesome services to empower the indie web. We aim to showcase the best of what the old/indie web had and still has to offer, while also embracing new technologies and emerging trends in web design.

Learn more about us [here](/about). Thanks for checking us out!
