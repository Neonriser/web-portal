# Begin your jorney!

Welcome to the new SurfScape, **your friendly Neocities web portal** inspired by the aesthetics and values of the old/indie web. We believe in a web that's free, creative, open, and community-driven, and we're passionate about preserving the spirit of the early internet.

At SurfScape, you'll find a wide range of services, resources, and a friendly community! We aim to showcase the best of what the old/indie web had and still has to offer, while also embracing new technologies and emerging trends in web design.
