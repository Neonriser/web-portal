Welcome to the Eversoul help center page! Here you can find useful information and answers to common questions about Eversoul.

## Tracking & Analytics

At Eversoul, we are committed to respecting our users' privacy. We do not sell user data or engage in any other type of tracking that would compromise your privacy. However, we do use [GoatCounter](https://www.goatcounter.com/) as our main analytic service to understand our viewer base and the toolset our users use. GoatCounter is a simple, fast, open source analytics service that respects users' privacy.

If you prefer not to be tracked, you can use an adblocker such as [uBlock Origin](https://ublockorigin.com/) to block the GoatCounter servers.

## User Generated Content

At this time, we do not have any plans to add user-generated content to Eversoul. We want to keep the portal as simple as possible since it is a static website. However, we appreciate your interest and welcome any feedback or suggestions you may have. Our entire codebase is hosted on GitHub and is written using the static site generator 11ty (Eleventy). If you would like to contribute to Eversoul, please feel free to open a pull request or submit an issue on our [GitHub repo](https://github.com/ReduxFlakes/eversoul).

## I want to help!

If you would like to suggest improvements or report a problem, please visit our GitHub page and [open an issue](https://github.com/ReduxFlakes/eversoul/issues/new/choose) or [pull request](https://github.com/ReduxFlakes/eversoul/compare). We will review your feedback and respond as quickly as possible.

We hope this help center page has been helpful. If you have any other questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to contact us.
