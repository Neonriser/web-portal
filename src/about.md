## About me

My name is ReduxFlakes, I am an open source Android app developer & web developer and _designer_ from Portugal and I'm currently studying computer science.

**Quick Facts:**

- I love music especially synthwave, heavy metal, rock, _nostaligc_ pop, chiptune and anything from the 80's.
- I love messing around with tech like homebrew and modding (I have a homebrewed PSP 3004 and my primary Android device running custom software).
- I love the old tech and the old web.
- I love open source software.
- I hate most modern music (excluding synthwave and chiptune).
- I hate modern software (let's be honest Windows 11 sucks).
