## About eversoul

Eversoul at first was going to be a personal site for me (ReduxFlakes), and it would actually become true for a week, but nothing lasts forever, and I had bigger ideas, so Eversoul became a web portal for Neocities.

At the moment (Feb. 13, 2023, to be exact), the site is very much bare bones, with a lot of issues related to layout, responsiveness, and lack of content, but in the next few weeks that will change.

To make Eversoul more connected to the community around it, its [source code](https://github.com/ReduxFlakes/eversoul) is public on GitHub!

## About me

My name is ReduxFlakes; I am an open-source Android app developer, web developer, and designer from Portugal, and I'm currently studying computer science.

I'm the creator of eversoul.

**Quick Facts:**

- I love music, especially synthwave, heavy metal, rock, "nostalgic" pop, chiptune, and anything from the 80s.
- I enjoy tinkering with technology, such as homebrew and modding (I have a homebrewed PSP 3004 and my primary Android device runs custom software).
- I adore vintage technology and the internet.
- I love open-source software.
- I hate most modern music (excluding synthwave and chiptune).
- I hate modern software (let's be honest, Windows 11 stinks).
