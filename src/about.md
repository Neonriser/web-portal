Welcome to Eversoul, your one-stop web portal for all your favorite content and communities, inspired by the web portals of the 2000s like MSN, AOL and Newgrounds. At Eversoul, we're passionate about creating a hub that brings the Neocitie community together, fosters creativity, and provides an escape from the chaos that we call the modern web.

Our vision for Eversoul is to be more than just another web portal. We want to create a community that's inclusive, supportive, and driven by our shared love of all things of the old/indie web. Whether you're a fan of games, entertainment, music, or just browsing the latest updates, Eversoul is the place for you.

## Origin

The idea for Eversoul started as a personal website, but as our ambitions grew, we realized we needed something bigger to bring our vision to life. That's when we started brainstorming ideas for a web portal that could provide a home for diverse communities, all under one roof. That's when Eversoul was born.

## Closing

At Eversoul, we're a team of passionate internet enthusiasts who come from all walks of life. We're developers who are united by our love of the internet and our desire to create a space that's both fun and safe. Whether you're interested in coding, design, or just exploring new content, we're here to help you get the most out of the web.

So come on in, explore our portal, and join our community. We can't wait to see what you'll discover at Eversoul!
