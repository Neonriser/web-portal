## Welcome

Welcome to SurfScape, **your friendly Neocities web portal** inspired by the aesthetics and values of the old/indie web. At SurfScape, we’re passionate about preserving the spirit of the early internet and creating a hub that brings the Neocities community together, fosters creativity, and provides an escape from the chaos that we call the modern web.

Our vision for SurfScape is to showcase the best of what the old/indie web had and still has to offer while embracing new technologies and emerging trends in web design. Whether you’re a fan of quirky personal pages, subversive zines, or awesome services to empower the indie web, SurfScape is the place for you.
