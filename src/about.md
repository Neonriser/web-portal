## About me

My name is ReduxFlakes; I am an open-source Android app developer, web developer, and designer from Portugal, and I'm currently studying computer science.

**Quick Facts:**

- I love music, especially synthwave, heavy metal, rock, "nostalgic" pop, chiptune, and anything from the 80s.
- I enjoy tinkering with technology, such as homebrew and modding (I have a homebrewed PSP 3004 and my primary Android device runs custom software).
- I adore vintage technology and the internet.
- I love open-source software.
- I hate most modern music (excluding synthwave and chiptune).
- I hate modern software (let's be honest, Windows 11 stinks).
