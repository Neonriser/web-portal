The purpose of this document is to give a reason of existence to the SurfScape Project. This includes our mission, goals, and actions to accomplish our purpose.

SurfScape mission is to show how much power the free, corporateless, community supported web has.

To accomplish this we serve a community, free services, and an open source portal for everyone that is interest in taking back the web and create their own place free of greed.

We show that everything is possible and that everyone has a voice to share their opinions.

We also belive that privacy is an important human right and we should fight back on corporations that take us back our control of our own data.

SurfScape is built by the community for free for everyone that wants to take back the web, if you agree with us and you want to fight back [join us](/community)!
