This update is not as big as the last ones but there are still a lot of improvement done.

## Additions

- **Music** - A database of my all time favourite artists, albums and songs all in a single page!
- **Last FM Widget** - I've added my old Last FM widget with a lot of improvements and with a less janky code so my stalkers can see what I'm listening and hopefully find new gems!
- **Webrings Widget** - Another new widget that shows all the webrings eversoul is enrolled in.
- **Other Button Section** - Added a new section to the buttons section with more abroad buttons.
- **New webring** - eversoul is now on null webring.

## Improvements

- **Mobile Responsiveness** - I've finally taken the time to fix some of the issues in the design when on mobile making the site much better to be used on mobile.
- **Social Cloud** - Fixed broken & added new social accounts to the webmaster widget social cloud.
- **Neocities Buttons** - Added 1 new site to the list.
