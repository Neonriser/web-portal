This is the first _stable_ release of eversoul with a lot of improvements over the older alpha/testing versions. Most of the issues are fixed, which means the website is ready for content.

Down below is the full list of changes, ordered by what type of changes were made (added, removed, or fixed).

## Additions

- **Left sidebar** - To make the website less cluttered I decided to seperate the layout into 2 sidebars and the main content in the middle instead of one huge sidebar.
- **Decentralized Navigation** - I've broken down the navigation into 3 new sections (navigation, cyberspace and projects).
- **Updates** - A list of all the versions and their respective changes.
- **Support Section** - A more user friendly sidebar section on how to support the website.
- **Sitemap** - A list of all the pages so search engines can find the website more easily.
- **Roadmap** - A simple roadmap to track progress on new additions to the website.

## Improvements

- **Layout responsiveness** - With the new layout, I decided to move both sidebars to the bottom and the main content all the way up for mobile users since, in mobile, content is the most important section.
- **Home page** - I've heavily improved the home page content structure and vocabulary.
- **Details/Summary** - I've improved the details/summary element for use inside sidebars.

## Removed

- **Broken links** - Removed most of the outdated/broken/repeated links.
